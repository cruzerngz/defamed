## Quick start

## Features

## Introduction
Python allows users to call functions with named and default parameters.

<details>

<summary>Python example</summary>

```py
# this function
def some_function(
    sign: bool,
    value: int,
    add: int = 0,
    div: int = 1
) -> int:
    if sign:
        return (value + add) / div
    else:
        return (0 - value + add) / div

# can be used like this:
assert some_function(True, 10) == 10
assert some_function(value = 20, sign = False, div = 2) == -10
assert some_function(True, 10, add = -10) == 0
```

</details>

This macro generates a function macro that accepts positional and named parameters.
Parameters tagged with default values can be omitted.

```rust
// this function
#[defamed::defamed]
fn some_function(
    sign: bool,
    value: i32,
    // for types that implement std::default::Default
    #[def]
    add: i32,
    // any const expression can be a default
    #[def(2 + 1 - 2)]
    div: i32
) -> i32 {
    if sign {
        value + add
    } else {
        0 - value + add
    } / div
}

// can then be used like:
assert!(some_function!(true, 10) == 10);
assert!(some_function!(value = 20, sign = false, div = 2) == -10);
assert!(some_function!(true, 10, add = -10) == 0);
```

## Parameter passing
The macro accepts parameters in any permutation as long as the following conditions are met:
- positional parameters order follows the original function signature
- all positional parameters are passed first
- named parameters come after all positional parameters
- named parameters can be included in any order
- default parameters are passed last
- default parameters can be excluded

<summary>Example</summary>

```rust
/// Add/sub 2 numbers, then take the absolute value, if applicable
#[defamed::defamed]
fn pos_and_def(
    lhs: i32,
    rhs: i32,
    #[def(true)]
    add: bool,
    #[def]
    abs_val: bool
) -> i32 {
    let inter = if add {lhs + rhs} else {lhs - rhs};
    if abs_val {inter.abs()} else {inter}
}

// original fn
assert_eq!(20, pos_and_def(5, 15, true, false));

// all positional
assert_eq!(20, pos_and_def!(5, 15, true, false));
// all named
assert_eq!(20, pos_and_def(lhs=5, rhs=15, add=true, abs_val=false));
// all named, in any order, defaults last
assert_eq!(20, pos_and_def(rhs=15, lhs=5, abs_val=false, add=true));
// defaults excluded
assert_eq!(20, pos_and_def!(5, 15));
// defaults excluded, positional in any order
assert_eq!(20, pos_and_def!(rhs=15, lhs=5));
// some positional, some named
assert_eq!(20, pos_and_def!(5, rhs=15));

// overriding first default parameter as positional
assert_eq!(20, pos_and_def!(25, 5, false));
// overriding second default parameter as named
assert_eq!(20, pos_and_def!(5, -25, abs_val=true));
```

## Macro scope
Macros generated by `defamed` can be exported and used by other crates, if the path to the underlying function is public.

The function macro generated by this crate needs to resolve to a valid function call at compile time.
So, the visibility of the source function determines how it ends up being called.

### Private
For functions that are used in the same module as they are defined, the macro resolves the call directly.
```rust
#[defamed::defamed]
fn local_scope() {}
// macro resolves to:
local_scope!() => local_scope()
```

When private functions are used inside child modules, the module path relative to the crate root needs to be provided.
```rust
#[defamed::defamed(crate)]
fn top_level_local_scope() {}

mod inner_consumer {
    fn inner() {
        super::top_level_local_scope!()
    }
}
```

### Public or Restricted
Functions with non-private visibility are called with their corresponding fully qualified path relative to the crate root.
The macro will require the module path to the function relative to the crate root.

For functions defined in the crate root, use `crate` as a path instead.

```rust
// public vis
#[defamed::defamed(crate)]
pub fn root_scope() {}

pub mod inner {
    // restricted vis
    #[defamed::defamed(inner)]
    pub(crate) fn crate_scope() {}
}

// macros resolve to:
crate_scope!() => $crate::inner::crate_scope()
root_scope() => $crate::root_scope()
```

<!-- ### Public
The call site of public functions differs whether a function is called within its own crate or by another crate.

For the macro to resolve local and external calls, crate-local calls need to include `crate:` in the function call signature.

> ```rust
> pub mod inner {
>     #[defamed::defamed(inner)]
>     pub fn exported_function() {}
> }
> // for invocations within crate:
> inner::exported_function!(crate:) => crate::inner::exported_function()
> // for invocations by other crates:
> CRATE_NAME::inner::exported_function!() => CRATE_NAME::inner::exported_function()
> ```

For top-level exported functions, add `crate` as a path to the proc-macro.
> ```rust
> #[defamed::defamed(crate)]
> pub fn exported_root_function() {}
> // invocations are the same as in the above example.
> ``` -->

## Benefits
- Better ergonomics
- More clarity during code reviews
- Seamless addition of default parameters to existing functions without breaking compatibility

## Limitations
This proc-macro currently works for standalone functions defined outside of an `impl` block. A fix is in the works.

## Notes 4 me
- Determine macro invocation semantics
    - no DSL (function macros only)
    - attr macro w/ pseudo helper-attrs
- Determine param permutations a-la Python
- Exporting macro in module (! @ crate root) based on visibility:
    - main issue: https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/59368
    - fix: https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/108241
    - rust-analyzer hinting has issues
- Problem when invoking macro from extern module/crate
    - similar crates do not export macro with function (named, etc..)
    - inner function requires fully qualified path
    - attempt 1: module_path!() macro
        - macro needs to expand after insertion in attributed code
        - parse &str from compiler builtin macro
        - macros evaluate lazily -> outer macro receives ItemMacro tokens
        - possible, but requires nightly
    - other attempts:
        - caller_modpath: https://docs.rs/caller_modpath/latest/caller_modpath/
            - also requires nightly
        - eager: https://docs.rs/eager/latest/eager/macro.eager.html
            - does not expand builtin macro
    - crate name eval can be done at compile time using proc-macros
        - evaluate "CARGO_PKG_NAME" env var inside macro

- Current (temp) solution: define crate path path as a parameter in attribute

- New (iffy) solution: multi stage macros
    - this solution requires that this library is also included by the user in their crate (double import)
    - first proc-macro generates actual function macro with all permutations and exports function macro under module scope
    - when called, function macro resolves to another proc-macro to eval crate root path (crate:: or otherwise). this proc-macro is provided by this crate, hence the need to double import
    - final function substituted in code

- New (less iffy solution): more macro permutations!
    - every macro permutation now has 2 variants: a crate-wide invocation and a public invocation.
    - any macro not called in the same scope as it was defined will need the fully qualified path of it's invoked inner function
    - a `crate:` prefix indicates that the macro substitutes code for invocation inside it's own crate
    - no prefix indicates that code should be substituted for users of that crate
